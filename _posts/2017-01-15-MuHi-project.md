MuHi makes possible to play a game, read a book, comunicate with others and generally use a pc with only the blink of the eyes: the numbers ( 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 ) corrispond to the eyes status, and MuHi acts like a virtual keyboard which sends virtual keystroke to the foreground application.

### Games and Applications
**This is a call for you, designers!**
I'm looking for (game) designers and developers to re-think common applications and games: as you may notice the main problem is to re-think the input system, using some hacks to make possible multiple interaction with only few inputs..!
For example, take the classic Sudoku game using an input system similar to the one used in the writer demo application.<br>
Now let's think about a program to draw, or something to read a ebook...<br>
In future versions, I'm thinking to implement some sort of system to interact with mouse, but I am not sure about the usability for the final user: remeber that mouse and keyboard were designed to be used with hands, not eyes..<br>

With the hackerspace MuHack, we are hosting a separate repo for all your ideas and code: it is not important if you can or cannot code something, we need ideas!

**At this moment we have problems with our hosting, just write me an email**

## Installation & Usage
**Requirements**
- opencv >= 2.4
- (Linux) xdo >=3

### Linux
We need OpenCV development library and XDoTool to compile and execute the program:
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv libxdo-dev
git clone https://github.com/MrMoDDoM/MuHi.git
cd MuHi/
./compile.sh
```

**To compile the Writer test app**
```
cd src/Writer/
./compile_writer.sh
```

...and now to lunch a program, for example the **writer** use:
```
./MuHi -p ./src/Writer/writer
```

### Windows
Just donwload & extract the zip file from [this link](https://github.com/MrMoDDoM/MuHi/releases/download/v1.1/MuHi-v1.1.zip)

### Basic usage
With the version 1.1, MuHi is now a stand alone application intended to be the "caller" of other application.
It sends keystroke based on eye status: the key is pressed and released quickly, and not held down.
As example application, the "Writer" is now a stand alone application too. It behaves exactly like in the 0.5 version, with the difference that now you have two different threads running.

There also some command-line options:
- -h                 Print this help and exit
- -p PATH_TO_PROGRAM The path to the target program: the MuHI system will lunch and attach to it
- -nologo            Launch the system without printing the logo
- -i                 Send only eye's close state: the system will react only when just one or both eye are close
- -l                 Long press the key: the virtual keystroke is released only on changes
- -d                 Activate the debug mode: in this mode the source frame and some information are displayed
- -s                 Activate the streamig mode: this way MuHi will continuosly output the status of eyes, and not only on changes
- -c NUM             Select the webcam index. 0 is normally the internal/default and 1 is the first USB cam connected.
- -k XXXXXX          (LINUX ONLY) SIX and ONLY SIX charaters to set as custom key sent on event. They stand for:
  * FIRST:          Both eyes are open
  * SECOND:         Rigth eye is close, left is open
  * THIRD:          Rigth eye is open, left is close
  * FOURTH:         Both eyes are close
  * FIFTH:          Temporary error (e.g. face not found, wating frame, ecc)
  * SIXTH:          Critical error, shut everything down.

##EXAMPLE:
```
./MuHi -c 1 -p [PATH/TO/]notepad.exe
```
This will use the webcam with index 1 and activate the debug mode, launching notepad.exe to work with
```
./MuHi -s -k asdfgh game.exe
```
This will set custom keys to "asdfgh", activate the streaming mode and launch game.exe

### Writer test app
The system uses the LEFT eye's blink to change the selector's direction, and the RIGHT eye's blink to make a "click"<br>
To pause or resume the writing process "click" on the "PAUSE" button<br>
To delete the last charater, use "CANC" and to empty the output use "ENTER"<br>


**Tips & Tricks: stay in a well lighted room, with no makeup or object (hair or glasses) covering your face.** 

## To-Do
- [x] Basic detection algorithm
- [x] Code structure object-oriented
- [ ] Documentations
- [ ] Code refactoring
- [x] API or a system to let other application/system to interact with

# Changelog 

### v1.1
- Thread support: MuHi is now able to launch a target application and detect when it closes to shut down itself; this prevent MuHi to stay active and send random keystrokes to random windows.
- Reimplemented Windows support, but at this point MuHi doesn't support custom keybinding on Windows machines
- With the "-i" switch is now possible to select only the "important" state changes (when from and open state the eye closes), which means the MuHi output only the second, third and fourth state.
- Correct some bugs that prevent MuHi to sustain "long blinks".
- With the "-l" switch the virtual key is held down insted of a quick press-and-release, even with "long blink".
- The "-nologo" switch prevents MuHi to print the opening logo in the terminal
- Bug fixes and stability improvements


### v1.0 - public beta
- MuHi is now a stand alone application: it now sends keystroke (0-1-2-3-4) to the focused window
- Temporally removed Windows support
- Added threshold auto-adjusting
- Moved Writer as a stand alone application
- Moved the cascade classifier to a separate folder

### v0.5
- Public beta
